***Instructions (ordered list):###H3***

1. Line a 12-cup muffin tray with cupcake liners.

2. Make the crust: mix crushed biscuits, brown sugar, and melted butter until combined. Divide evenly into liners and press firmly. Freeze 10–20 minutes.

3. Make the filling: beat cream cheese and sugar until smooth; add icing sugar, sour cream, lemon juice, and vanilla — beat until creamy.

4. Whip the cream: beat cold heavy cream until stiff peaks form (about 4–5 minutes).

5. Fold: gently fold whipped cream into the cream-cheese mixture until fully combined.

6. Assemble: spoon filling over chilled crusts, smooth.

7. Chill: refrigerate at least 3–4 hours or overnight (best).

8. Serve: top with berries, lemon zest, caramel shards, or extra whipped cream before serving.
